#Blog Application
This project is a simple microservices-based blog platform where users can create blog posts and comment on posts. The application is divided into two microservices:

Post Service: Manages the creation and retrieval of blog posts.
Comment Service: Manages user comments on blog posts.
Both services are containerized using Docker and use Flask as the backend framework and SQLite as the database.
